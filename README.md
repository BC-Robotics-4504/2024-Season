# 2024-Season: Buckeye Regional

## Robotpy Setup

BC Robotics (Team #4504) has designed their 2024 FIRST Robotics submission using [Robotpy](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/robot.html) with the [MagicBot Framework](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/magicbot.html). To keep the relevant libraries current, the following code will need to be run regularly in a terminal interface:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install robotpy wpilib
robotpy installer download-python
robotpy installer install-python
robotpy sync
robotpy installer download robotpy[all]
robotpy installer install robotpy[all]
```

## Robot Controls

### **[GameSir G7 Wired Controller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BM9HRCCV?ref_=cm_sw_r_apin_dp_ER34REM3C1FQSY0W5MQR)**

- Input device ID `0`
- **Left Joystick**: Move Robot along the Y-axis
- **Right Joystick**: Moves robot along X-axis
- **Right Trigger**: Open Grabber
- **Left Trigger**: Closes Grabber
- **Y**: Score a High Goal  
- **B**: Score a Mid Goal  
- **A**: Return superstructure to default positon  
- **Back**: Fully retracts superstructure and disables break
- **Start**: Fully retracts superstructure  
- **D-Pad Up**: Pickup from loading zone

## Game Controller Functionality  

- **<Score_High>**: Score a high goal
- **<Score_Mid>**: Score a medium goal
- **<Score_Low>**: Score a low goal
- **<controller_floor>**: Picks up a gamepiece from the ground  
- **<controller_station>**: Picks up a gamepiece from the loading zone  
- **<controller_autonomous>**: Controls autonomous mode


## Autonomous Operation

  **Our autonomous plan is as follows...**

  1. Backup .5 meters
  2. Extend grabber and elevator
  3. Move up .5 meters
  4. Score a gamepiece (preferably cube)
  5. Backup 3 meters and exit the communtity (when .5 meters is reached the superstructure retracts.)
