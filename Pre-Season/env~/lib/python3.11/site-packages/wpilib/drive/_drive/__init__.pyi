    Each Drive() function provides different inverse kinematic relations for a
    differential drive robot. Motor outputs for the right side are negated, so
    motor direction inversion by the user is usually unnecessary.

    This library uses the NED axes convention (North-East-Down as external
    reference in the world frame):
    http://www.nuclearprojects.com/ins/images/axis_big.png.

    The positive X axis points ahead, the positive Y axis points to the right,
    and the positive Z axis points down. Rotations follow the right-hand rule,
    so clockwise rotation around the Z axis is positive.

    Inputs smaller then 0.02 will be set to 0, and larger values will be scaled
    so that the full range is still used. This deadband value can be changed
    with SetDeadband().

    RobotDrive porting guide:

    * :meth:`tankDrive` is equivalent to ``RobotDrive.tankDrive``
      if a deadband of 0 is used.
    * :meth:`arcadeDrive` is equivalent to ``RobotDrive.arcadeDrive``
      if a deadband of 0 is used and the the rotation input is inverted,
      e.g. ``arcadeDrive(y, -rotation, squareInputs=False)``
    * :meth:`curvatureDrive` is similar in concept to
      ``RobotDrive.drive`` with the addition of a quick turn
      mode. However, it is not designed to give exactly the same response.
